## Model Strategy

```
Orchestrator (main conversation): model=opus   — judgment, phase transitions, quality gates
Writer:                           model=sonnet  — document writing, research compilation
Critic-A (UX + Brand):           model=sonnet  — user experience, brand identity, aesthetics
Critic-B (Visual + Accessibility): model=sonnet — visual design, WCAG compliance, quality
Critic-C (Tech + Performance):   model=sonnet  — implementation feasibility, performance, bundle size
```

---

## Team Party Mode

### Party Mode 3R (3 Round Review)

```
Round 1: Writer writes section → Critic-A, Critic-B, AND Critic-C review in parallel → cross-talk → feedback
Round 2: Writer revises → Critics re-review → cross-talk → feedback
Round 3: Writer finalizes → Critics verify → score

Pass condition: avg score >= 7/10 (average of ALL THREE critics)
Fail: retry (max 2) → escalate → continue
```

### Party Mode 2R (Research phases — lighter)

```
Round 1: Writer compiles research → Critic-A, Critic-B, AND Critic-C review → cross-talk → feedback
Round 2: Writer revises → Critics verify → score

Pass condition: avg score >= 7/10 (average of ALL THREE critics)
```

### Critic Role Assignments (UXUI Specialized)

**Critic-A (UX + Brand):**
- **Sally (UX Designer):** "실제 유저가 이걸 3초 안에 이해할 수 있나?" — 유저 옹호자
- **Luna (Brand Strategist):** "CORTHEX의 정체성과 맞지 않는다." — 브랜드 일관성

**Critic-B (Visual + Accessibility):**
- **Marcus (Visual Designer):** "시각적 위계가 무너졌다." — 미적 판단
- **Quinn (QA + A11y):** "색상 대비 3.2:1, WCAG AA 불합격." — 접근성 + 품질

**Critic-C (Tech + Performance):** [NEW in v1.1]
- **Amelia (Frontend Dev):** "이 레이아웃은 CSS Grid로 3줄이면 된다." — 구현 현실성
- **Bob (Performance):** "이 애니메이션 60fps 못 나온다." — 성능 현실성

### Writer Prompt Template (UXUI Mode)

```
You are a UXUI REDESIGN WRITER in team "{team_name}".
Model: sonnet. YOLO mode — auto-proceed, never wait for user input.

## CRITICAL PROHIBITION
- NEVER use the Skill tool for writing redesign documents
- NEVER write more than ONE step before sending review request
- NEVER auto-proceed to next step — WAIT for Orchestrator's instruction

## Your Per-Step Loop (MANDATORY)

### Phase 1: Write
1. Read the step instruction from Orchestrator
2. Read ALL reference documents listed in instruction
3. Read prior context-snapshots for decisions from earlier phases
4. Write the section — CONCRETE, SPECIFIC, NO PLACEHOLDERS
   - Bad: "use professional colors" → Good: "Primary: #6366F1 (Indigo-500), hover: #4F46E5"
   - Bad: "add a sidebar" → Good: "w-64 fixed left-0 h-screen bg-slate-900 border-r border-slate-700"
5. Record: which file, which lines (start - end)

### Phase 2: Request Review
6. SendMessage to "critic-a": "[Review Request] {step_name}. File: {path} lines {start}-{end}"
7. SendMessage to "critic-b": "[Review Request] {step_name}. File: {path} lines {start}-{end}"
8. SendMessage to "critic-c": "[Review Request] {step_name}. File: {path} lines {start}-{end}"
9. STOP AND WAIT for ALL THREE critics.

### Phase 3: Fix
10. Read ALL THREE critic logs FROM FILE
11. Apply ALL fixes
12. Write fix summary to party-logs/{phase}-{step}-fixes.md

### Phase 4: Verify
13. SendMessage to all three critics: "[Fixes Applied]"
14. WAIT for verification scores from ALL THREE critics.

### Phase 5: Score & Next
15. avg of 3 critics >= 7: PASS → save context-snapshot → report to Orchestrator
16. avg < 7 AND retry < 2: rewrite
17. avg < 7 AND retry >= 2: ESCALATE

## Output Quality (ABSOLUTE RULE)
All outputs must be SPECIFIC and DETAILED.
- Colors: exact hex + Tailwind class (e.g., `bg-indigo-500 (#6366F1)`)
- Spacing: exact values (e.g., `gap-6 (24px)`, `p-4 (16px)`)
- Typography: exact font + weight + size (e.g., `Inter 600 text-lg (18px/28px)`)
- Layout: exact CSS/Tailwind (e.g., `grid grid-cols-[280px_1fr] h-screen`)
- No vague words: "clean", "modern", "professional" → replace with SPECIFIC visual specs
```

---

## Critic-C Prompt Template (Tech + Performance)

```
You are CRITIC-C in team "{team_name}", reviewing from tech/performance perspective.
Model: sonnet. YOLO mode.

## Your Roles (play both in character)
- **Amelia (Frontend Dev):** "이 레이아웃은 CSS Grid로 3줄이면 된다. 이건 불가능." — 구현 현실성
- **Bob (Performance):** "이 애니메이션 60fps 못 나온다. 이미지 4MB는 3G에서 10초." — 성능 현실성

## Your Workflow

### On Review Request
1. Read the file FROM DISK at the path given by Writer
2. Also read _corthex_full_redesign/context-snapshots/*.md for prior decisions
3. Also read _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md and any design-tokens.md in _corthex_full_redesign/

### Amelia's Review
- Is this implementable in React/Tailwind? Be specific about what works and what doesn't.
- Component count: is this realistic? Too many custom components needed?
- Third-party dependencies: are any required that aren't already in the project?
- CSS/layout feasibility: will the proposed layout actually work in the browser?

### Bob's Review
- Will it perform? Estimate bundle size impact for any new dependencies.
- Image optimization: are any large images or heavy assets called for?
- Animation fps: will proposed animations run at 60fps? Name specific problematic ones.
- Loading time on slow connections: any critical path blockers?

### Required Output
- Find minimum 2 issues (one from Amelia, one from Bob)
- Write review to _corthex_full_redesign/party-logs/{phase}-{step}-critic-c.md
- Format:
  ## Critic-C Review: {step_name}
  ### Amelia (Frontend Dev)
  [in-character comment, 2-3 sentences minimum]
  Issues: [numbered list of specific problems]
  ### Bob (Performance)
  [in-character comment, 2-3 sentences minimum]
  Issues: [numbered list of specific problems]
  ### Score: {X}/10
  ### Required Fixes: [numbered list]
- Cross-talk: SendMessage to critic-a and critic-b with summary of tech/perf concerns

## Rules
- ALWAYS read FROM FILE before reviewing
- Cross-check against architecture.md and design-tokens.md
- In-character comments: 2-3 sentences minimum per role
- Zero findings = re-analyze (not allowed to pass with no issues)
- Score honestly: vague/unimplementable outputs score <= 4
```

- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/v1-feature-spec.md
- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md (vision, mission sections)
- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md (design philosophy)
- CLAUDE.md (project direction)

Write the following sections:

## 1. What is CORTHEX?
- One-paragraph elevator pitch
- The problem it solves (AI agents need organizational structure)
- Why it exists (not just another chatbot — it's an AI ORGANIZATION MANAGER)

## 2. Core Vision
- "Not 29 fixed agents — admin can freely create/edit/delete departments, human staff, AI agents"
- Dynamic org management as the fundamental differentiator
- The NEXUS metaphor (visual org chart = living nervous system)

## 3. Who Uses CORTHEX?
- Primary persona: 비개발자 조직 관리자 (non-dev org manager)
- Secondary persona: 기술 관리자 (tech admin)
- What they care about (control, visibility, trust in AI)

## 4. Emotional Design Direction
- What should users FEEL when using CORTHEX?
  - In control (not overwhelmed by AI complexity)
  - Professional (enterprise-grade, not toy-like)
  - Intelligent (the tool itself feels smart)
  - Trust (transparent AI decisions, not black box)
- What CORTHEX is NOT:
  - Not a chatbot interface (it's an org management tool)
  - Not playful/casual (it manages real business operations)
  - Not cluttered (despite many features, it should feel simple)

## 5. Brand Personality
- Voice: confident, precise, trustworthy
- Visual metaphor candidates (neural network? corporate HQ? command center? constellation?)
- Color emotion targets (what feelings should colors evoke?)
- Typography personality (authoritative but approachable)

## 6. Feature Hierarchy (for UI priority)
Rank ALL features by user importance:
- P0 (always visible): ...
- P1 (one click away): ...
- P2 (settings/admin): ...
- P3 (power user): ...

## 7. Competitive Positioning
- vs Slack (we're not a chat app)
- vs Linear/Jira (we're not a project manager)
- vs custom AI dashboards (we're a full org system)
- What makes CORTHEX's UI unique?

## 8. Design Principles (for all subsequent phases)
5-7 design principles that ALL future design decisions must follow.
Example: "Show the org, not the AI" — users should see their organization structure, not raw AI interfaces.
```

**Critic-A Focus:** 비전이 설득력 있는지, 감정 방향이 모순 없는지, 유저 페르소나가 현실적인지
**Critic-B Focus:** 기능 계층이 기술적으로 맞는지, 경쟁 포지셔닝이 정확한지
**Critic-C Focus:** 디자인 원칙이 구현 가능한지, 성능 목표가 현실적인지 (Lighthouse 점수 등)

For each option: pros, cons, CORTHEX fit score.

## Component Inventory
List EVERY component CORTHEX needs, categorized:

### Primitives (atoms)
Button, Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle, Badge, Avatar, Tooltip, etc.
For each: variants, sizes, states, props interface

### Composites (molecules)
Card, Modal, Dropdown, Tabs, Breadcrumb, Pagination, Toast, etc.

### Features (organisms)
AgentCard, OrgChart (NEXUS), ChatWindow, KnowledgePanel, TierBadge, etc.

### Layouts
AppShell, Sidebar, Header, PageContainer, SplitPane, etc.

## Component API Standards
- Prop naming conventions
- Variant pattern (cva? class-variance-authority?)
- Composition pattern (compound components? render props?)
- Accessibility requirements per component (ARIA roles, keyboard nav)

## Stitch → React Migration Strategy
How generated Stitch components will be decomposed into this system:
- What Stitch generates (monolithic pages)
- How to break into reusable components
- What to keep, what to rewrite
- Naming convention mapping
```

## Phase 4: Theme Creation (테마 생성)

### Step 4-1: Creative Themes (Party 3R)

**Output:** `phase-4-themes/themes-creative.md`

**Writer Instruction:**
```
[Step Instruction] Create 5 creative CORTHEX themes.
Output: _corthex_full_redesign/phase-4-themes/themes-creative.md

Read: ALL previous phase outputs + context-snapshots

Create 5 DISTINCT, CREATIVE themes for CORTHEX.
Each theme must be dramatically different from the others.
Use the design tokens from Phase 3 as the base, with theme-specific overrides.

For EACH theme:

## Theme Name: [Creative Name]
### Concept
- One-line pitch: "..."
- Visual metaphor: (what real-world thing does this look like?)
- Mood board description: (imagine 4 images that capture this mood)
- Design movement influence: (which movement inspires this?)

### Color Override
- Primary: [hex] — why this color
- Accent: [hex]
- Background: [hex]
- Full palette with all token overrides

### Typography Override
- Heading font: [name] — why
- Body font: [name] — why
- Character: what personality does this type give?

### Visual Details
- Sidebar style: (transparent? solid? gradient? glass?)
- Card style: (bordered? elevated? flat? glassmorphism?)
- Button style: (sharp? rounded? pill? ghost?)
- Icon style: (outlined? filled? duotone?)
- Animation mood: (snappy? smooth? playful? minimal?)

### Sample Screen Description
Describe the main dashboard as it would look in this theme:
- Exact layout with Tailwind classes
- Exact colors applied to each element
- How the sidebar looks
- How an agent card looks
- How the NEXUS org chart looks

### Who This Theme Is For
- What kind of user would love this?
- What emotion does it evoke?
- What industry/context fits best?

THEME IDEAS TO EXPLORE (suggestions, not requirements):
1. Neural Network / Synapse — dark, glowing nodes, data-flow animations
2. Corporate Command Center — clean, authoritative, Bloomberg-terminal-like
3. Minimalist Nordic — white space, calm, paper-like textures
4. Cyberpunk HQ — neon accents, dark backgrounds, tech-forward
5. Nature / Organic — earth tones, gentle curves, breathing animations
```

### Step 4-2: Accessibility Audit (1R Verification)

**Output:** `phase-4-themes/themes-accessibility-audit.md`

**Writer Instruction:**
```
[Step Instruction] WCAG 2.1 AA audit for all 5 themes.
Output: _corthex_full_redesign/phase-4-themes/themes-accessibility-audit.md

For EACH theme, verify:
- All text/bg color combinations meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- Interactive elements have focus indicators
- Color is never the sole means of conveying information
- Motion respects prefers-reduced-motion
- Touch targets >= 44×44px (mobile)

Use contrast ratio calculations for every color pair.
Flag failures with specific fix suggestions.
```

## Phase 5: Prompt Engineering (프롬프트)

### Step 5-1: Web Stitch Prompt (Party 3R)

**Output:** `phase-5-prompts/stitch-prompt-web.md`

**Writer Instruction:**
```
[Step Instruction] Create Google Stitch prompt for CORTHEX web version.
Output: _corthex_full_redesign/phase-5-prompts/stitch-prompt-web.md

Read: ALL previous phase outputs (especially winning theme + design tokens + component strategy)

Create a DETAILED, READY-TO-PASTE prompt for Google Stitch that will generate
CORTHEX's web dashboard UI.

The prompt must include:
1. Project description (what CORTHEX is, who uses it)
2. Exact visual specifications (from design tokens + winning theme)
3. Page-by-page descriptions:
   - Dashboard/Hub main view
   - Agent management page
   - NEXUS org chart view
   - Knowledge library page
   - Chat/conversation view
   - Admin settings
   - Landing page (pre-login)
4. Component specifications (from component strategy)
5. Color palette (exact hex values)
6. Typography (exact fonts + sizes)
7. Layout structure (exact grid/flex specifications)
8. Interaction specifications (hover, click, transitions)
9. Responsive breakpoints
10. "Generate as React with Tailwind CSS" instruction
    (Fallback: "Generate as HTML first, then I will convert to React")

The prompt should be structured so Stitch can generate EACH PAGE separately
(multiple prompts if needed — one per page).

Also create a "master prompt" that establishes the design system for all pages.
```

### Step 5-2: App Stitch Prompt (Party 3R)

**Output:** `phase-5-prompts/stitch-prompt-app.md`

(Same structure but for mobile app, with Stitch mobile-specific instructions)

---

## Phase 6: External Generation (사용자 수동)

```
이 Phase는 사용자가 직접 수행합니다:
1. phase-5-prompts/의 프롬프트를 복사
2. Google Stitch에 붙여넣기
3. 생성된 결과물을 phase-6-generated/web/ 및 phase-6-generated/app/에 배치
4. 사용자가 "Phase 7 시작"을 요청하면 Orchestrator 재개

Orchestrator는 이 Phase에서 대기합니다.
pipeline-status.yaml에 "phase-6: waiting-for-user"로 기록.
```

---

## Phase 7: Integration (통합)

### Step 7-1: Component Decomposition (Party 3R)

**Output:** `phase-7-integration/component-decomposition.md` + 실제 코드

**Writer Instruction:**
```
[Step Instruction] Decompose Stitch output into React components.

Read: phase-6-generated/ (Stitch output) + phase-3 component strategy

1. Analyze Stitch-generated code
2. Identify reusable components
3. Map to component inventory from Phase 3
4. Create component files in packages/ui/src/ or packages/app/src/components/
5. Apply design tokens from Phase 3
6. Ensure TypeScript types are correct
```

### Step 7-2: Routing & State (Party 3R)

```
Connect components to React Router.
Set up state management (React Context / Zustand / etc.)
Wire up navigation between pages.
```

### Step 7-3: API Binding (Party 3R)

```
Connect React components to actual backend API endpoints.
Wire up SSE for real-time features.
Implement data fetching (SWR/React Query/native fetch).
Verify all CRUD operations work end-to-end.
```

### Step 7-4: Accessibility Final Audit (Party 3R)

```
Full WCAG 2.1 AA audit on the integrated product.
Keyboard navigation testing.
Screen reader testing.
Color contrast verification.
Focus management verification.
Performance audit (Lighthouse).
```

## Orchestrator Execution Flow

```
Step 0: Setup
  → mkdir -p _corthex_full_redesign/{phase-0..7 subdirs}
  → Initialize pipeline-status.yaml
  → TeamCreate (team: uxui-redesign)

Step 1: For each Phase (0 through 5):
  → Read pipeline-status.yaml for current state
  → Read ALL context-snapshots/*.md
  → Spawn Writer + Critic-A + Critic-B + Critic-C for the Phase
  → For each Step in Phase:
    → Send [Step Instruction] to Writer
    → Monitor party mode (timeout: 15min per step)
    → Validate party-logs exist
    → Verify score >= 7
  → On Phase complete:
    → git add _corthex_full_redesign/
    → git commit: "docs(uxui-redesign): Phase {N} complete -- {steps} steps, party-{2R|3R}"
    → Update pipeline-status.yaml
    → Shutdown team, spawn fresh for next Phase

Step 2: Phase 6 (User Manual)
  → Update pipeline-status.yaml: "phase-6: waiting-for-user"
  → Report to user: "Phase 5 완료. Stitch 프롬프트 준비됨. 생성 후 phase-6-generated/에 넣어주세요."
  → STOP

Step 3: Phase 7 (User triggers)
  → Spawn new team
  → Execute 4 integration steps
  → Final commit + push + deploy verification

Step 4: Report
  → "UXUI Redesign Pipeline 완료. {total_steps} steps, {total_party_rounds} party rounds."
```

## Defense Mechanisms (from kdh-full-auto-pipeline)

- max_retry: 2 per step (FAIL 3x = ESCALATE)
- step_timeout: 15min + 2min grace (stall 3x = SKIP)
- Party-log validation: critic-a.md + critic-b.md + critic-c.md + fixes.md must exist
- Context-snapshot after EVERY step
- On respawn: inject ALL context-snapshots
- Team failure → single-worker fallback
- Pipeline never blocks — timeout/fail/escalate always leads to "continue"

---

### Timeout Strategy
- step_timeout: 15 minutes (per UXUI step)
- party_timeout: 15 minutes (per party round)
- grace_period: 2 minutes
- stall_threshold: 5 minutes (no message = stalled)
- max_stalls: 3 → SKIP step

---

### Anti-patterns & Failure Modes

#### Inherited from kdh-full-auto-pipeline (v6.0)
1. Writer calls Skill tool → bypasses critic review loop
2. Writer batches all steps → critics can't give step-by-step feedback
3. Orchestrator says "run this skill" → Writer calls Skill tool
4. Shutdown-before-continue race
5. Workers skip mandatory skills
6. Stale resources (tmux/worktree/team) accumulate

#### UXUI-Specific (to be filled after v1.1 execution)
- [TBD — document failures during first run]

---

### Context Snapshot Schema
After each step, save to: _corthex_full_redesign/context-snapshots/{phase}-{step}-snapshot.md

Contents:
  ## {step_name}
  - Decisions: (what was decided and why)
  - Design tokens referenced: (exact hex, Tailwind classes)
  - Constraints for next step: (what MUST be respected)
  - Connections: (how this relates to previous steps)
  - Critic scores: A={X}/10, B={X}/10, C={X}/10

---

## Absolute Rules

1. ALL outputs must be SPECIFIC (exact hex, exact Tailwind, exact px). "Vague" = instant FAIL.
2. Writer NEVER uses Skill tool — reads instructions and writes manually
3. Writer writes ONE step → review → fix → verify → THEN next step
4. Every step must produce a context-snapshot for cross-phase continuity
5. Phase 1 research must cite REAL URLs and REAL products (no made-up references)
6. Design tokens must include WCAG AA contrast ratios for all text/bg pairs
7. Stitch prompts must be COPY-PASTE READY (no "[fill in]" placeholders)
8. Phase 7 integration must produce WORKING code (no stubs/mocks)
9. git commit after each Phase (not per step)
10. Orchestrator=opus, Workers=sonnet
11. Model strategy can be overridden by user request only
12. pipeline-status.yaml is the single source of truth for progress
13. On resume: read pipeline-status.yaml + ALL context-snapshots before proceeding
14. 3 Critics required for all party mode phases (A: UX+Brand, B: Visual+A11y, C: Tech+Performance)
15. Anti-patterns from kdh-full-auto apply to this pipeline (shared team engine)
16. Context snapshots include exact design token values (hex, Tailwind classes, px)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Writer produces vague output ("clean colors", "modern layout")
**Fix:** Critic-A, Critic-B, and Critic-C MUST reject with specific replacement suggestions. Score 0 for vague outputs.

### Research phase finds no good references
**Fix:** Expand search to adjacent domains (fintech dashboards, healthcare admin UIs, etc.)

### Stitch can't generate React directly
**Fix:** Prompt includes fallback: "Generate as HTML with Tailwind first, then convert to React"

### Phase 7 integration breaks existing functionality
**Fix:** npx tsc --noEmit before every commit. Run existing tests. Never merge breaking changes.

### User changes design direction mid-pipeline
**Fix:** Use pipeline-status.yaml to mark phases as "invalidated". Re-run from the changed phase forward.
